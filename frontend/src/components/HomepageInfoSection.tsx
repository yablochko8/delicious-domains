        It includes lots of the "dot-something" domains (e.g. .art, .book,
        .cat). Conventional wisdom says these are a terrible idea.{" "}

        advocates to stick to dotcom domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, there are now over 1,000 top-level domains, and you probably
        haven't heard of most of them. If you just need a quick, cheap,
        descriptive domain they open up a ton of options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every domain shown should come in under $100, with the exception of .ai
        domains which have a sneaky two-year minimum. Dreamy Domains excludes
        all premium / resale / auction domains from results.
