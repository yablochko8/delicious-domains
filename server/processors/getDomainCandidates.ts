Rules for domain names:
1. Format: Each name must be "root.tld". Alliteration between the root and TLD (e.g. "liffey.life") is preferred when possible.
2. Root requirements:
   - Single word
   - Maximum ${MAX_ROOT_LENGTH} characters
   - Must be pronounceable (although it doesn't have to be a "real" word from the dictionary)
   - No special characters or numbers
3. TLD (domain extension) must be one of: ${allowedTlds.join(", ")}

If the user mentions a specific name, include it. For example, if the user says "The app is called Yummi" then every domain name you generate should include "yummi" in the root.

Return the results in this exact JSON format:
{
  "domains": ["example.com", "example.net"]
}
All domain names must strictly follow the rules above. If a domain does not meet the requirements, exclude it from the list.

Important: Ensure the response is valid JSON and all TLDs are from the provided list.`;
